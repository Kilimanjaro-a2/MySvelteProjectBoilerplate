# MySvelteProjectBoilerplate

This repository is a template of settings that I often use in my own projects using Svelte.

Just run the `yarn install` command and you can start developing a project using the following packages right away.

-   Svelte
-   TypeScript
-   Tailwind CSS
-   ESLint
-   Prettier
-   Jest
-   Webpack

Currently, there is a problem that Lint does not work with .svelte files combined with TypeScript.

There may be some other strange settings due to my lack of knowledge.
